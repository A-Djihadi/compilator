2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell C_reg_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) C_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch C_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin C_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch O_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin O_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch TKN_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin TKN_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
